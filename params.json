It enables listening from unsupported countries with the use of a proxy. Pandora's song skipping limits are honoured in order to avoid possible account banning. Pandorian is intended for Pandora listeners who do not like to have a web browser open all the time and/or find it a hassle to setup a system-wide proxy or having to dial a VPN connection every time they would like to listen to Pandora. Alternatively, if your country is supported, simply change a setting to not use a proxy and enjoy listening...\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n===========\r\n- Change stations\r\n- Like/ Dislike songs\r\n- Block a song for a month (tired of song)\r\n- Play/ Pause current song\r\n- Skip songs\r\n- Large album art display\r\n- Song/ Artist/ Album info\r\n- System-wide HotKeys for main functions\r\n- Volume normalizing with ReplayGain info\r\n- Choose streaming audio quality\r\n- Honours Pandora song skipping rules to avoid account being banned\r\n- Supports Pandora One accounts for higher audio quality\r\n- Built-in proxy enabled browser to log in to Pandora website\r\n- All connections go through proxy server\r\n- Supports usage without a proxy if your country is supported\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n===============\r\n- MS Windows 64bit\r\n- MS DotNet Framework 2.0\r\n- Proxy server account\r\n- Pandora account\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n==========\r\n- [PandoraMusicBoxEngine] (https://code.google.com/p/pandora-musicbox/) \r\n- [BASS] (http://www.un4seen.com/)\r\n\r\nDownloads:\r\n============\r\n- [Latest Setup] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pandorian/) \r\n- [Source Code] (https://github.com/dj-nitehawk/pandorian)\r\n\r\nSupport/Feedback:\r\n=================\r\nIf you need support or would like to send some feedback, please [create a new issue here] (https://github.com/dj-nitehawk/Pandorian/issues)\r\n\r\nTo Do:\r\n======\r\n- User configurable hotkeys\r\n- Sleep/Shutdown timer\r\n- Minimize to tray\r\n- Move non-gui functions in to pandora engine\r\n- Gui improvements + volume slider\r\n\r\nVersion History\r\n===============\r\nv1.5.3\r\n- Enable listening without using a proxy\r\n- Don't count a skip if the current song has been in a paused state and song duration has elapsed.\r\n\r\nv1.5.2.2\r\n- Enforce total skips per day for free users to 24 to prevent 40sec blank audio.\r\n\r\nv1.5.2.1\r\n- Prevent app from crashing after pandora sending blank audio tracks.\r\n\r\nv1.5.2\r\n- Added system-wide hotkeys for main functions\r\n  - Play/Pause Current Song: ALT + SPACE\r\n  - Like Current Song: ALT + L\r\n  - Dislike Current Song: ALT + D\r\n  - Skip Current Song: ALT + S\r\n  - Block Current Song: ALT + B\r\n  - Show/Hide Pandorian: ALT + P\r\n\r\nv1.5.1\r\n- Minor bug fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nv1.5\r\n- Added support for Pandora One accounts\r\n\r\nv.1.4.3\r\n- Added two new items to the right click menu\r\n  - Check for an update\r\n  - Show current version\r\n\r\nv1.4.2\r\n- Reduced calls to pandora by implementing a playlist per station\r\n\r\nv1.4.1 \r\n- Remember song skips across app restarts\r\n\r\nv1.4\r\n- Right click on album cover to:\r\n  - Manage Station\r\n  - Show Settings\r\n\r\nv1.3 \r\n- Engine converted to vb\r\n- Swapped out blowfish procedures\r\n- Moved dll locations\r\n- Better handling of missing album cover art\r\n- General bug fixes and code clean up\r\n\r\nv1.2 \r\n- Select streaming audio quality\r\n\r\nv1.1 \r\n- Several major bug fixes and performance improvements\r\n\r\nv1.0 \r\n- Initial release\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
