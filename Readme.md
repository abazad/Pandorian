Pandorian v1.5.3
================

Pandorian is a clutter free, lightweight and easy to use desktop client for Pandora. It enables listening from unsupported countries with the use of a proxy. Pandora's song skipping limits are honoured in order to avoid possible account banning. Pandorian is intended for Pandora listeners who do not like to have a web browser open all the time and/or find it a hassle to setup a system-wide proxy or having to dial a VPN connection every time they would like to listen to Pandora. Alternatively, if your country is supported, simply change a setting to not use a proxy and enjoy listening...
